# Weekly Summary and Impact Report Generator

This project provides services to generate weekly summaries and impact reports for players based on their playthroughs. It is built with Ruby and uses Bundler for dependency management.

## Project Description

The application includes two main services:

1. **Weekly Summary Generator**: Generates a summary of players' activities for a given week, including total scores and time spent.
2. **Impact Report Generator**: Generates a report showing the impact of players by calculating the difference between their best and first scores.
